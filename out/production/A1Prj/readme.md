In your A1Prj directory (should be the parent directory of this src directory), use this command to run simulator:

java -cp  out/artifacts/A1Prj/A1Prj.jar:JavaSE.jar com.codename1.impl.javase.Simulator org.ecs160.a1.AppMain

In your src directory, use git pull/add/commit/push for regular git operations

Little suggestion: maybe use two terminals of different paths for convenience.
